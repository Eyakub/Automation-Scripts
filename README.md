# Python Automation Scripts 
You'll have a project structure like this of Django

```
project_name
|--...
|--venv
|   |--
|   |--
|--src
|   |--root_application
|   |   |--__init__.py
|   |   |--settings.py
|   |   |--urls.py
|   |   |--wsgi.py
|   |   |...
|   |--manage.py   
|   
```

[I've followed this structure, rest of other application have to create by following this link](https://gist.github.com/Eyakub/9459897a8ae04c12d175b36657b346b7)
