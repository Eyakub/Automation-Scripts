# Python Automation Scripts 
You'll have a project structure like this of Django

```
project_name
|__...
|__venv
|   |__Scripts
|   |__bin
|   |...
|__src
|   |__root_application
|   |   |____init__.py
|   |   |__settings.py
|   |   |__urls.py
|   |   |__wsgi.py
|   |   |...
|   |__manage.py   
|   
```

[I've followed this structure, rest of other application have to create by following this link](https://gist.github.com/Eyakub/9459897a8ae04c12d175b36657b346b7)
